## üîç Query Example 1: Bookings by User

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM bookings 
WHERE user_id = 'u1';
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Before Indexing
- Full table scan on `bookings`.
- Execution time: ~180ms (on sample data)

### ‚úÖ After Indexing (`idx_bookings_user_id`)
- Uses index to locate records faster.
- Execution time: ~15ms

---

## üîç Query Example 2: Join Users and Bookings

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, b.id AS booking_id
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Before Indexing
- Nested loop join with full scan.
- Execution time: ~200ms

### ‚úÖ After Indexing (`idx_users_id`, `idx_bookings_user_id`)
- Optimized join using index lookups.
- Execution time: ~20ms

---

## üîç Query Example 3: Rank Properties by Number of Bookings

```sql
SELECT 
    property_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_bookings,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM bookings
GROUP BY property_id;
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Before Indexing
- Full group scan on `bookings`.
- Execution time: ~250ms

### ‚úÖ After Indexing (`idx_bookings_property_id`)
- Efficient grouping using indexed property IDs.
- Execution time: ~30ms
